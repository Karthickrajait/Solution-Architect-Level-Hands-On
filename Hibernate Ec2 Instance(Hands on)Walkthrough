Ec2 hibernate instance hands on.

Step 1 ->

      open aws management console.

Step 2->
	go to Ec2 Services.

Step 3->
	give a name(demo-Hibernate-Session).

Step 4->
	launch Instance >AMI amazon linux images> instance type t2.micro .

Step 5->

	security group -> Create Security Group 
        allow SSH and HTTP port > and Save security group.

Step 6->

        key pair -> 
	proceed without key pair.

Step 7->

    	Storage volume". 
   	->enable volume Encryption.
   	->enable Default kms.
Step 6->

 	finalyy -> move to Advanced details
 	Scroll down You can see Hibernate behaviour -> enable it 
	finally click on launch instances.

Step 7->

        go to instance running
	open ec2 instance that you have created.

Step 8->
        
        connect it with Ec2 Instance Connect .
        Enter Command   <uptime> in the SSH.
	
        DeScription About uptime command
        
        >And there is one command called uptime that is quite special
	because uptime allows you to know for how long the instance has been turned on.
	So if you do uptime,it says that right now it's been up for zero minutes.

Step 9->
  
	So let's disconnect from our instance and what we're going to do now
	is that we're going to hibernate the instance.

	to do so -> Go to instance Running -> Select the istance where we enable Hibernate.
        Select Action->Hibernate Instance. wait for 2 minutes till machine stops.
      
Step 10->
	Start the machine Again
    	now connect our instance with Ec2 Instance Connect
     	do the command <uptime>
	restarted it from an operating system perspective,the instance was never stopped.
	It was hibernated.And therefore the uptime command gives you two or three minutes,
	because it has never quote unquote been stopped from an operating system perspective.
	which is the whole idea behind hibernation.
	So that's it.\\ Terminate  Your Ec2 Instance After This Session.
